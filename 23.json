Without this option items like the login and sharing pages won't be styled. You can also decide to automatically enable or disable the theme based on the theming choice reported by the browser. In the global options you will also find an option to exclude the login page from being themed. You can find the global options here:\n\n```\nAdmin settings > Theming > Breeze Dark\n```\n\nPlease note that you need the Theming app enabled in Nextcloud to access the global settings.\n\n### Personal\n\nThe personal option allows each user to set their own preference independent of how you set the global option. If the user hasn't set an option yet, they will follow the global option. They can also choose, independently, if they want the theme to match the theming choice reported by the browser. You can find the personal option here:\n\n```\nPersonal settings > Accessibility > Breeze Dark\n```\n\nPlease note that you need the Accessibility app enabled in Nextcloud to access the personal setting.\n\n### Custom styling\n\nUnder the Theming section in the admin settings you can add your own custom styling to the theme. Only standard CSS can be used. This custom styling will be applied whenever the theme is enabled and only affects the Breeze Dark theme.",

    "description": "[Pico CMS for Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/cms_pico) combines the power of [**Pico**](http://picocms.org/) and [**Nextcloud**](https://nextcloud.com/) to create simple, secure, shareable and amazingly powerful websites with just a few clicks. Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS - making the web easy.\n\n* Start a blog\n* Share your resume with the world\n* Create a plan for world domination and only share with the right friends\n* Build a knowledge base and let the smart ones among your colleagues help out\n\nInstalling Pico CMS for Nextcloud allows your users to create and manage their own websites. Creating a new page with Pico is no more than creating a simple text file in a users' Nextcloud files. No config is required, no utterly complex management interfaces - just files. It's the perfect match with Nextcloud. Secure Sharing, Collaboration, Access Control - not just for your files, but also your websites, all made possible by Pico CMS for Nextcloud! Breaking the boundaries between your Mobile & Desktop devices and your Server.\n\nWebsites will be accessible through URLs like `https://cloud.example.com/sites/my_site/` and consist of just a bunch of `.md` text files in a user's Nextcloud files. `.md` stands for [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - a super simple and intuitive markup to create headings, paragraphs, text formatting, lists, images and links. But don't despair - you don't have to learn yet another language if you don't want to. Consider enabling Nextcloud's [Markdown Editor](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_markdown) app to make easy things stupidly simple. Please note that Nextcloud's built-in Text editor is incompatible with Pico CMS for Nextcloud. But what about meta data like a page's title or release date? Guess right, it's all in one place. At the top of your Markdown files you can place a block with such meta data - called the [**YAML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) Front Matter. Creating websites can't be easier‚Ä¶\n\nBut that wasn't everything‚Ä¶ Pico CMS for Nextcloud is highly customizable. You can change Pico‚Äôs appearance by using custom themes and add new functionality by using custom plugins. For security reasons users can neither add custom themes nor plugins on their own - but as an admin you can. Plugins and themes aren‚Äôt just new \"skins\" or \"widgets\", the underlying technologies are powerful frameworks you can leverage to make your users' websites truly unique. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Pico CMS for Nextcloud does its best to prevent users from including scripts into websites, since this might bear security risks (so called \"Cross Scripting\"). Since this risk doesn't apply to Pico itself, 3rd-party developers of plugins and themes might not be aware of this issue - so be careful when installing custom plugins and themes.\n\nYou want to learn more about Pico CMS for Nextcloud? Easy! Just download and enable the app from [Nextcloud's App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cms_pico) and navigate to Nextcloud's settings page. As an admin you'll find two \"Pico CMS\" sections in your Nextcloud settings - one below \"Personal\", another below \"Administration\". The latter allows you to add custom themes, plugins and templates to Pico, as well as tweaking some advanced settings. The \"Pico CMS\" section below \"Personal\" exists for all Nextcloud users and allows one to create personal websites. Simply create your first personal website and choose \"sample_pico\" as website template. Pico's sample contents will explain all you need to know‚Ä¶",

See https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/duplicatefinder\n\n    Click on the icon and find if you have duplicate files.\n\n    You can either use the command or the cron job to do a full scan.\n    Each time a new file is uploaded or a file is changed the app automatically checks if a duplicate of this file exists.\n\n    ## Usage\n    Beginning with version 0.0.9 the detection of duplicates has changed. If you're updating from an older version you don't have to do anything special.\n    There are there are three possible ways duplicates can be detected.\n    1. Event-based-detection\n       For every new or changed file Nextcloud creates an internal event. The app is listening to these and analyse if the file has a duplicate\n    2. Background-job-based-detection\n       With an interval of 5 days a background job is executed, if you have enabled either cron, webcron or ajax based background jobs. This is only for events that have not been processed for any reason or a file was added manually.\n    3. Command-based-detection\n       A scan for duplicates can be forced by using the occ-command (please see #Command usage)\n\n    Normally the detection-methods should by used in the order as listed, but if you are installing the app on an existing installation it can be quite useful to start with a full scan by using the command-based-detection.\n\n    ## Command usage\n\n      `occ [-v] duplicates:ACTION [options]`\n\n    Depending on your NextCloud setup, the `occ` command may need to be called differently, such as `sudo php occ duplicates:find-all [options]` or `nextcloud.occ duplicates:find-all [options]`. Please refer to the [occ documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/15/admin_manual/configuration_server/occ_command.html) for more details\n\n    If you increase the verbosity of the occ command, the shows a little bit more what is currently done (e.g. what file is currently scanned).\n\n        ACTION\n        find-all    The command scans the files for duplicates. By using the options the scan can be limited\n          options\n            -u, --user scan files of the specified user (-u admin)\n            -p, --path limit scan to this path (--path=\"./Photos\"). The path is relative the root of each user or the specified user.\n        list        The command lists all duplicates that have been found until yet. If no option is given duplicates across users are shown.\n          options\n            -u, --user list only duplicates of the specified user (-u admin)\n        clear       The command will clear all information that has been stored in the database\n          options\n            -f, --force the flag forces to do the cleanup. _attention_ you will not be asked any questions\n\n    ## Preview\n\n    ![Preview of the GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulLereverend/NextcloudDuplicateFinder/master/img/preview.png)",

Accept QES while never exposing your file to a remote service\n\nCurrently, this app enables the user to gather a single signature onto an existing file:\n1. Pick a file which you want signed by another person\n1. Select \"Signing\" in the file's dropdown menu\n1. Enter the signer's email address\n1. The signer receives a link on their e-mail\n1. They sign the document\n1. The signed document appears in your Nextcloud instance, next to the original file\n\n# Built on top of eID Easy\nThe app uses [eID Easy](https://eideasy.com) as its signing back-end. eID Easy handles the signing process. Refer to [eID Easy's pricing](https://eideasy.com/pricing/) to see the cost of each signing method.\n\n### Get ‚Ç¨10 to try out eID Easy\nFor limited time only, we're offering ‚Ç¨10 of credit that you can spend to try out all the eID Easy signing services.\n\nWrite to support@eideasy.com to claim this offer.\n\n# Two levels of electronic signatures\n*Qualified Electronic Signature* - the strongest kind of electronic signature. The signer's identity and approval is linked to the file contents and a timestamp by cryptographic means. The signing time and the document's integrity can be verified to ensure that the document has not been tampered with after signing.\n\nWith QES, you can opt to only send the file hashes to eID Easy. This way, the actual content of your files is never exposed to a third party.\n\n*Simple Electronic Signature* - the simplest kind of electronic signature. eID Easy sends a unique link to the signer's e-mail. The signer opens the link, reviews the file and confirms their approval. A visual signature is added to the file. eId Easy adds a cryptographic e-seal to the file, to ensure that it cannot be modified after signing.\n\nWith Simple Electronic Signatures, the contents of your file need to be sent to eID Easy. This provides legal value to the signature, as we can state with certainty that the signer had the opportunity to review the file they were signing.\n\n# Feedback is welcome\nAre you not seeing your preferred signature card / signing app / other QES method? Are we not quite covering your use case? Let us know at support@eideasy.com",

It works for publications formatted according to the following standards:\n\n - [Epub]\n - [PDF]\n - [CBR and CBZ] ('comics')\n\nFor Epub Reader uses the futurepress [epub.js] renderer to provide near-native looks, especially when used full-screen. Turn pages by pressing the left/right hand side of the screen/window or using the cursor keys (if you have those), use the sidebar to browse through chapters or bookmarks and add annotations.\n\nPDF is handled by Mozilla's [pdf.js] renderer in combination with a custom reader app to enable side-by-side display, batch search and more. Controls are like those used in the Epub renderer with a few exceptions, e.g. night mode has not been implemented yet.\n\nCBR and CBZ are supported using a custom renderer inspired by [balaclark]'s work. As with Epub, books can be navigated using the keyboard as well as mouse or touch navigation. Reader generates a visual index of all pages, show in the sidebar (thumbnail generation can be disabled for low-memory and/or -speed devices). As CBx files are often of varying quality, a set of image enhancement filters are provided.\n\nSee [README] for more exhaustive information on features and potential misfeatures of this app.\n\n   [epub.js]: https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js\n   [Epub]: http://idpf.org/epub\n   [CBR and CBZ]: https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/CBR_and_CBZ\n   [balaclark]: https://github.com/balaclark/HTML5-Comic-Book-Reader\n   [PDF]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\n   [pdf.js]: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\n   [README]: https://github.com/e-alfred/epubreader/blob/master/epubreader/README.md",

GPX, KML, CSV (unicsv format) and geotagged JPG are supported for loading. JPG files are loaded as waypoints. Files can be loaded in GpxEdit interface or in Files app.\n\nGo to [GpxEdit Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/gpxedit) if you want to help to translate this app in your language.\n\nThis is not a perfect GPX editor.\n\nWhat's saved :\n- metadata\n    - name\n    - link url\n    - link text\n- tracks\n    - name\n    - comment\n    - description\n    - points\n        - coordinates\n        - elevation (just preserves loaded values)\n        - time (just preserves loaded values)\n- waypoint\n    - coordinates\n    - name\n    - comment\n    - description\n    - symbol\n    - elevation (just preserves loaded value)\n    - time (just preserves loaded values)\n\nGpxEdit does load/save time data. Elevation data is loaded and saved but every new waypoint/track/trackpoint added by user actions in GpxEdit will have neither elevation nor time data. There is an \"approximate\" option to set elevation to new points if surrounding points have elevation data.\n\nTracks are saved with one segment (trkseg tag).\n\nGpxEdit :\n- allows you to add extra symbols in admin settings (section : additional)\n- works with server-side encryption.\n- works with shared files.\n- loads GPX, KML, unicsv CSV, geotagged JPG files (no more Gpsbabel dependency)\n- loads tracks, routes and waypoints\n- saves tracks, routes and waypoints\n- supports waypoint symbols\n- uses [Leaflet.Draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) and [Leaflet.draw.plus](https://github.com/Dominique92/Leaflet.draw.plus) amazing plugins\n- uses many other Leaflet plugins like Minimap, Sidebar2, MeasureControl, MousePositionControl\n- adds possibility to edit .gpx files directly from the \"Files\" app\n- is able to cut lines in two\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 14 with Firefox and Chromium.\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Installation\n\nCheck the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/gpxedit-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details, integration in \"Files\" app and GpxEdit admin settings.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nIf you look for more powerfull GPX editors, take a look at :\n- [Viking](https://sourceforge.net/projects/viking/) which is the best IMHO\n- [QLandKarteGT](https://bitbucket.org/kiozen/qlandkarte-gt)\n- [QMapShack](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/wiki/Home)\n- [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/)\n\n\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

This way, you can use OpenID Connect to login to Nextcloud while maintaining an LDAP backend with attributes with the LDAP plugin. Supports automatic discovery of endpoints through the OpenID Connect spec, with a single provider configuration attribute.",

Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n* üìç Display location history\n* ‚õõ Filter points\n* ‚úé Manually edit/add/delete points\n* ‚úé Edit devices (rename, change colour/shape, move to another session)\n* ‚õ∂ Define geofencing zones for devices\n* ‚öá Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n* üñß Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n* üîó Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n* üñ´ Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n* üó† Display sessions statistics\n* üîí [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorised user can log with this name\n* üóì Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n* ‚óî Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colours and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated. See [admindoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc#issue-with-phonetrack-restricted-to-some-groups-in-nextcloud).\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

It can be used in conjunction with Asterisk, \nto benefit from the control, autonomy and advanced PBX features offered by Asterisk, but also without Asterisk, if \nyou connect it directly to the SIP provider (this implies that the SIP provider allows direct connections from WebRTC \napplications). For calls to and from regular phone numbers, a SIP provider like Telnyx or Localphone is needed and \na real phone number acquired from that SIP provider. If Asterisk is used, it has to be Asterisk version 18.0.0 LTS \nand it has to be installed on a VPS or dedicated server, as explained in the 'Admin documentation' linked on this \npage. The web server has to be configured to allow access to a specific directory and to proxy WebSocket traffic to \na specific URL, as explained in detail in the 'Admin documentation'. Not all SIP providers allow direct connections \nfrom external Asterisk servers or from WebRTC applications. Telnyx and Localphone allow direct connections from their \nclients' Asterisk servers and Telnyx also allows direct connections from WebRTC applications. SIP Trip Phone is based \non the ctxSip phone.\n\nMain features:\n\n* üìû SIP Trip Phone allows making and receiving calls to/from any mobile or landline phone at lower rates than with regular phones. It is known that VoIP phone calls are up to 70% cheaper than regular phone calls. International VoIP phone calls can cost even 90% less than regular phone calls.\n\n* üåê You can acquire phone numbers in countries of your choice and make cheap international phone calls to receivers in those countries. When calling you back on those numbers, the receivers will pay as for local calls.\n\n* üÜì If Asterisk is used, you can make free calls over the Internet between extensions configured on the underlying Asterisk server.\n\n* ‚òéÔ∏è  SIP Trip Phone logs recent phone calls and their duration and allows pausing, muting and transferring phone calls.\n\n* üö© On-screen notifications on incoming calls.\n\n* üìÉ Once you open SIP Trip Phone, you can use it even if you are logged out of Nextcloud.\n\n* üíª If Asterisk is used, on the underlying Asterisk server you can implement an IVR (Interactive Voice Response or 'voice menu') and many advanced PBX features such as voicemail, queue management, music on hold, number blacklisting, call recording, audio conference calls, etc.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for a phone number. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Low per minute prices: if Asterisk is used, you can make calls within the US starting from $0.0050 per minute and receive calls with $0.0075 per minute or less (Telnyx), or $0.0060 per minute for outgoing calls and $0 for incoming calls (Localphone). If SIP Trip Phone is connected directly to Telnyx, you can make and receive phone calls with $0.0020 per minute in the US.\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx or Localphone. The quality of services and low prices are the only reasons for choosing them as SIP providers.",

    "description": "This application allows sending and receiving SMS messages in Nextcloud. An SMS enabled phone number acquired from \nTelnyx or Plivo is needed. We have no affiliation with Telnyx or Plivo. \nThe 'libcurl' PHP library has to be present on the server. Detailed and complete instructions on how to use this application can be found on the 'Admin documentation' page.\n\nMain features:\n\n* üöÄ Use one or multiple local phone numbers in countries of your choice, to send and receive SMS messages with your browser, on any device connected to the Internet.\n\n* üìë Sent and received SMS messages are stored in the database per sending/receiving user and can be viewed in paginated tables with filters for every column.\n\n* üìî SMS messages older than a specified number of days can be deleted in bulk with one click and they are automatically archived in csv files stored in Nextcloud, before being removed from the database. This makes them available for future analysis.\n\n* üíª Sending SMS messages to thousands of recipients is easy: a txt/csv file containing the recipients' phone numbers is uploaded and the SMS is sent automatically to all. The time interval between two consecutive messages is configurable.\n\n* üîè Incoming SMS message requests are checked for authenticity by verifying Telnyx'/Plivo's signature.\n\n* üìß Users receive notifications and (optionally) emails when new SMS messages arrive.\n\n* üìÑ Each sent message receives a delivery receipt displayed in the Sent SMS Messages table.\n\n* üì± It works with regular 'long code' (10-digit) phone numbers, but also with 'toll-free' numbers and 'short codes'. Users see a list with their current phone numbers and can set them as Sender IDs. Setting alphanumeric Sender IDs is also possible. \n\n* üíµ It allows checking the current Telnyx/Plivo balance by selecting the provider on the left panel.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for an SMS enabled phone number located in a country chosen by the user. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Very low prices per SMS: starting from $0.0025 per sent message and $0 per received message (Telnyx) or $0.0050 per sent message and $0 per received message (Plivo) in the USA.",

    "description": "# Social login\n\nMake possible create users and login via Telegram, OAuth or OpenID\n\nFor OAuth you must create app for certain providers. Login button appear at login page if app id specified. Settings are in \"Social login\" section of settings page.\n\n## Installation\n\nLogin to your NextCloud installation as an administrator and under \"Apps\" click \"Download and enable\" next to the \"Social Login\" app.\n\nSee below for setup and configuration instructions.\n\n\n\n## Custom OAuth2/OIDC groups\n\nYou can use groups from your custom provider. For that you should specify \"Groups claim\" in custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. That claim should be returned from provider in `id_token` or at user info endpoint. Format should be `array` or comma separated string. Eg (with claim named `roles`)\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\nor\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nAlso nested claims is supported. For example `resource_access.client-id.roles` for\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThere is also support for setting the displayName:\n```\n{\"roles\": [{gid: 1, displayName: \"admin\"}, {gid: 2, displayName: \"user\"}]}\n```\n\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1. Map provider groups to existing nextcloud groups\n2. Create provider groups in nextcloud and associate it to user (if appropriate option specified)\n\nIf you want sync groups on every login do not forget to check \"Update user profile every login\" setting\n\n## Examples for groups\n\n* You can find example how to configure WSO2IS for return roles claim with OIDC [here](https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff)\n* [GitLab OIDC allowing specific GitLab groups](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/gitlab.md)\n\n## Built-in OAuth providers\n\nYou can copy link of certain login button to get proper \"redirect url\" for OAuth app setting.\n\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top)\n* [Telegram](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/telegram.md)\n\nDetails about \"Allow login only from specified domain\" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)\nYou can use comma separated list for multiple domains\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' => true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.\nIf you want to temporary disable this function (e.g. for login as local admin), you can add `noredir=1` query parameter in url for login page. Something like `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`\n\nTo set options for http client, you can use\n```php\n  'social_login_http_client' => [\n    'timeout' => 45,\n    'proxy' => 'socks4://127.0.0.1:9050', // Check https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html for allowed variants\n  ],\n```\nin `config.php`\n\n### Configurate a provider via CLI\n\nYou can configure everything from commandline by using the occ utility. To setup a oidc-provider replace the variables and URLs with values that match your deployment.\n```bash\nphp occ config:app:set sociallogin custom_providers --value='{\"custom_oidc\": [{\"name\": \"gitlab_oidc\", \"title\": \"Gitlab\", \"authorizeUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/authorize\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/token\", \"userInfoUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/userinfo\", \"logoutUrl\": \"\", \"clientId\": \"$my_application_id\", \"clientSecret\": \"$my_super_secret_secret\", \"scope\": \"openid\", \"groupsClaim\": \"groups\", \"style\": \"gitlab\", \"defaultGroup\": \"\"}]}'\n```\nto do this with docker you just need to add `docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME` in front of the command, or run it interactively from `docker exec -it -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME sh`\n\nTo find out how to configure other providers, just configure them in the GUI and take a look at the database afterwards:\n```\nmysql -u nextcloud -p nextcloud\nPassword: <yourpassword>\n\n> SELECT * FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid='sociallogin';\n```\n\nOr just run\n\n`docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME php occ config:app:get sociallogin custom_providers`\n\n## Hint\n\n### About Callback(Reply) Url\nYou can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url. To make proper button visible, just fill certain provider settings with random data and change it later.\n\nSome users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.\nPlease set 'overwriteprotocol' => 'https', in your config.php file.",

This app provides a chat based interface to interact with the Talked server component that handles the actual recording.\n\nCheck out the [Talked server repo](https://github.com/MetaProvide/talked) for more information on how this works and what the current limitations are.\n\n## Installation and setup\n\nIt's available in the [Nextcloud app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/talked), just search for Talked and you should be able to find it.\n\nOr you can clone this repo into your app folder and enable it in the app menu in Nextcloud.\n\n### Register chat command\n\nTo use the chat command to interact with the Talked server, the command first needs to be registered with Talk. You can register a command using the occ command. The exact command depends on how you have installed Nextcloud. Below I'll have an example for the official docker container and the snap. For more information about registering a chat command, check out the Talk documenation: https://nextcloud-talk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/\n\nYou will find two examples for both the docker container and snap. The only difference is whether you want to allow all registered users in a room to start a recording, or only the moderators.\n\n#### Docker container\n\n##### Only moderators can use\n```\nphp occ talk:command:add recording Talked \"php /var/www/html/occ talked:record {ROOM} {ARGUMENTS}\" 2 1\n```\n##### All registered users can use\n```\nphp occ talk:command:add recording Talked \"php /var/www/html/occ talked:record {ROOM} {ARGUMENTS}\" 2 2\n```\n\n#### Snap\n\n##### Only moderators can use\n```\nocc talk:command:add recording Talked \"php /var/www/html/occ talked:record {ROOM} {ARGUMENTS}\" 2 1\n```\n##### All registered users can use\n```\nocc talk:command:add recording Talked \"php /var/www/html/occ talked:record {ROOM} {ARGUMENTS}\" 2 2\n```\n\n### Configuring Talked\n\nAfter you have registered the Talk command you should configure Talked. If you head to Admin settings > Talk, then you will find the settings for Talked near the bottom. Here you can specify the URI for your Talked server and whether to use HTTP Basic auth, and the credentials for HTTP Basic auth.\n\nThe http / https should be included in the url, for example: https://talked.example.com\n\nYou can also connect to the Talked server over a unix socket. To specify the path to a unix socket prefix the path with `unix:` for example: `unix:/tmp/talked.sock`.\n\nPlease note that abstract sockets aren't supported.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use Talked, simply use the `/recording` command in a chat room. If you don't specify any options or run `/recording help` you will get a help message telling you about the different options. The following options are available:\n\n* `/recording start` - starts a recording in the current room.\n* `/recording stop`  - stops the active recording.\n* `/recording status` - checks if there is an active recording.\n* `/recording info` - prints the version number of the Talked server.\n* `/recording help` - prints a help message with the different options.",

Features include:\n\n# Adding entries\nWith the integrated timer, you only need to press start and stop! Times will be stored automatically, with 1-second-precision. Forgot to press start? Just use the manual editor, to add entries from the past. Or edit existing ones in case you need to change something!\n\n# Projects, Clients and Tags\nAssign tasks to projects and clients! This allows you to display aggregated durations for each project or client, or filter for tasks by projects or clients. You need some more categorization? That's what tags are made for! Create tags to categorize tasks independently from projects or clients.\n\n# Lost track of your work time?\nNo problem! Just use the Dashboard view to display a nice donut / pie chart of your tasks! Or filter for tasks in the Reports or Timeline view to display total or aggregated values.\n\nThis app is still under development, so stay tuned for updates and additional features! If you have any suggestions, bug reports or feature requests, feel free to head over to our [GitHub project page](https://github.com/mtierltd/timetracker) and search through the existing issues, maybe your topic is already under discussion! And if it's not, feel free to file a new issue for it.\n\nAnd for now, start making your time tracking easier by using this app!",
