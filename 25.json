    "description": "[Pico CMS for Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/cms_pico) combines the power of [**Pico**](http://picocms.org/) and [**Nextcloud**](https://nextcloud.com/) to create simple, secure, shareable and amazingly powerful websites with just a few clicks. Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS - making the web easy.\n\n* Start a blog\n* Share your resume with the world\n* Create a plan for world domination and only share with the right friends\n* Build a knowledge base and let the smart ones among your colleagues help out\n\nInstalling Pico CMS for Nextcloud allows your users to create and manage their own websites. Creating a new page with Pico is no more than creating a simple text file in a users' Nextcloud files. No config is required, no utterly complex management interfaces - just files. It's the perfect match with Nextcloud. Secure Sharing, Collaboration, Access Control - not just for your files, but also your websites, all made possible by Pico CMS for Nextcloud! Breaking the boundaries between your Mobile & Desktop devices and your Server.\n\nWebsites will be accessible through URLs like `https://cloud.example.com/sites/my_site/` and consist of just a bunch of `.md` text files in a user's Nextcloud files. `.md` stands for [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - a super simple and intuitive markup to create headings, paragraphs, text formatting, lists, images and links. But don't despair - you don't have to learn yet another language if you don't want to. Consider enabling Nextcloud's [Markdown Editor](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_markdown) app to make easy things stupidly simple. Please note that Nextcloud's built-in Text editor is incompatible with Pico CMS for Nextcloud. But what about meta data like a page's title or release date? Guess right, it's all in one place. At the top of your Markdown files you can place a block with such meta data - called the [**YAML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) Front Matter. Creating websites can't be easier‚Ä¶\n\nBut that wasn't everything‚Ä¶ Pico CMS for Nextcloud is highly customizable. You can change Pico‚Äôs appearance by using custom themes and add new functionality by using custom plugins. For security reasons users can neither add custom themes nor plugins on their own - but as an admin you can. Plugins and themes aren‚Äôt just new \"skins\" or \"widgets\", the underlying technologies are powerful frameworks you can leverage to make your users' websites truly unique. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Pico CMS for Nextcloud does its best to prevent users from including scripts into websites, since this might bear security risks (so called \"Cross Scripting\"). Since this risk doesn't apply to Pico itself, 3rd-party developers of plugins and themes might not be aware of this issue - so be careful when installing custom plugins and themes.\n\nYou want to learn more about Pico CMS for Nextcloud? Easy! Just download and enable the app from [Nextcloud's App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cms_pico) and navigate to Nextcloud's settings page. As an admin you'll find two \"Pico CMS\" sections in your Nextcloud settings - one below \"Personal\", another below \"Administration\". The latter allows you to add custom themes, plugins and templates to Pico, as well as tweaking some advanced settings. The \"Pico CMS\" section below \"Personal\" exists for all Nextcloud users and allows one to create personal websites. Simply create your first personal website and choose \"sample_pico\" as website template. Pico's sample contents will explain all you need to know‚Ä¶",

It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).\n\nYou can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share money with others.\n\nIt lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.\n\nProject members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.\n\n[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).\n\n[PayForMe](https://github.com/mayflower/PayForMe) iOS client is currently being developped!\n\n## Features\n\n* ‚úé create/edit/delete projects, members, bills, bill categories, currencies\n* ‚öñ check member balances\n* üó† display project statistics\n* ‚ôª display settlement plan\n* üéá automatically create reimbursement bills from settlement plan\n* üóì create recurring bills (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)\n* üìä optionally provide custom amount for each member in new bills\n* üîó link bills with personal files (picture of physical bill for example)\n* üë© guest access for people outside Nextcloud\n* üë´ share projects with Nextcloud users/groups/circles\n* üñ´ import/export projects as csv (compatible with csv files from IHateMoney)\n* üîó generate link/QRCode to easily import projects in MoneyBuster\n* üó≤ implement Nextcloud notifications and activity stream\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 20+ with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is under development.\n\nüåç Help us to translate this app on [Nextcloud-Cospend/MoneyBuster Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/moneybuster).\n\n‚öí Check out other ways to help in the [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [User documentation](https://github.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/docs/user.md)\n* [Admin documentation](https://github.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/docs/admin.md)\n* [Developer documentation](https://github.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/docs/dev.md)\n* [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log)\n* [AUTHORS](https://github.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors)\n\n## Known issues\n\n* it does not make you rich\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n* üìç Display location history\n* ‚õõ Filter points\n* ‚úé Manually edit/add/delete points\n* ‚úé Edit devices (rename, change colour/shape, move to another session)\n* ‚õ∂ Define geofencing zones for devices\n* ‚öá Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n* üñß Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n* üîó Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n* üñ´ Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n* üó† Display sessions statistics\n* üîí [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorised user can log with this name\n* üóì Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n* ‚óî Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colours and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated. See [admindoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc#issue-with-phonetrack-restricted-to-some-groups-in-nextcloud).\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

    "description": "A browser phone that can be connected to SIP providers via Asterisk or directly. It can be used in conjunction \nwith Asterisk, to benefit from the control, autonomy and advanced PBX features offered by Asterisk, or without \nAsterisk, if connected directly to the SIP provider. For calls to and from regular phone numbers, a SIP provider \nlike Telnyx or Localphone is needed and a real phone number acquired from that SIP provider. If Asterisk is used, \nit's recommended to be Asterisk version 18.0.0 LTS and it has to be installed on a VPS or dedicated server, as \nexplained in the 'Admin documentation' linked on this page. The web server has to be configured to allow access \nto a specific directory and to proxy WebSocket traffic to a specific URL, as explained in the 'Admin documentation'. \nNot all SIP providers allow connections from external Asterisk servers or direct connections from web applications \nthat use SIP over WebSocket, like SIP Trip Phone. Thus, you can connect this application to Telnyx, Localphone, \nTwilio, Flowroute, Vonage, etc. via an Asterisk server, but if you want to connect it directly to the SIP provider, \nfrom the 5 mentioned providers, only Telnyx will work, because the others don't allow direct connections from web \napplications using SIP over WebSocket.\nSIP Trip Phone is based on the ctxSip phone.\n\n### Features:\n\n* üìû SIP Trip Phone allows making and receiving calls to/from any mobile or landline phone at lower rates than with regular phones. It is known that VoIP phone calls are up to 70% cheaper than regular phone calls. International VoIP phone calls can cost even 90% less than regular phone calls.\n\n* üåê You can acquire phone numbers in countries of your choice and make cheap international phone calls to receivers in those countries. When calling you back on those numbers, the receivers will pay as for local calls.\n\n* üÜì If Asterisk is used, you can make free calls over the Internet between extensions configured on the underlying Asterisk server.\n\n* ‚òéÔ∏è  SIP Trip Phone logs recent phone calls and their duration and allows pausing, muting and transferring phone calls.\n\n* üö© Incoming calls are signaled by on-screen notifications.\n\n* üìÉ Once you open SIP Trip Phone, you can use it even if you are logged out of Nextcloud.\n\n* üíª If Asterisk is used, on the underlying Asterisk server you can implement an IVR (Interactive Voice Response or 'voice menu') and many advanced PBX features such as voicemail, queue management, music on hold, number blacklisting, call recording, audio conference calls, etc.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for a phone number. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Low per minute prices: if Asterisk is used, you can make calls within the US starting from $0.0050 per minute and receive calls with $0.0075 per minute or less (Telnyx), or $0.0060 per minute for outgoing calls and $0 for incoming calls (Localphone). If SIP Trip Phone is connected directly to Telnyx, you can make and receive phone calls with $0.0020 per minute in the US.\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx, Localphone, Twilio, Flowroute or Vonage.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Admin documentation](https://www.doublebastion.com/install-nextcloud/#install-sip-trip-phone)\n\n### Donations\n\n* üéÅ [Donate](https://www.doublebastion.com/donations/)",

The 'libcurl' PHP library has to be installed on the server. Detailed instructions \non how to configure and use this application can be found on the 'Admin documentation' page.\n\n### Features:\n\n* üöÄ Use one or multiple local phone numbers in countries of your choice, to send and receive SMS/MMS messages with your browser, on any device connected to the Internet.\n\n* üìë Sent and received SMS/MMS messages are stored in the database per sending/receiving user and can be viewed in paginated tables with filters for every column.\n\n* üñºÔ∏è Up to 10 files of various formats, including jpeg, png and gif, can be sent as MMS messages from MMS enabled phone numbers. Files included in incoming MMS messages are not downloaded automatically. They are stored as URL links to the actual files, so that the receivers can download them only if they trust the senders.\n\n* üìî SMS/MMS messages older than a specified number of days can be deleted in bulk with one click and they are automatically archived in csv files stored in Nextcloud, before being removed from the database. This makes them available for future analysis.\n\n* üíª Sending SMS/MMS messages to thousands of recipients can be achieved by uploading a txt/csv file containing the recipients' phone numbers and the same SMS/MMS is sent automatically to all. The time interval between two consecutive messages is configurable.\n\n* üîè SMS/MMS messages coming from Telnyx, Plivo and Twilio are checked for authenticity by verifying the SMS provider's signature.\n\n* üìß Users receive notifications in Nextcloud and (optionally) emails when new SMS/MMS messages arrive.\n\n* üìÑ Each sent message receives a delivery receipt displayed in the Sent SMS Messages table.\n\n* üì± It works with regular 'long code' (10-digit) phone numbers, but also with 'toll-free' numbers and 'short codes'. Users see a list with their current phone numbers and can set them as Sender IDs. Setting alphanumeric Sender IDs is also possible. \n\n* üíµ It allows checking the current Telnyx/Plivo/Twilio balance by selecting the provider on the left panel.\n\n* üí∞ The only ongoing cost is about $1 per month (depending on the country) for an SMS/MMS enabled phone number located in a country chosen by the user. No contracts.\n\n* üí∏ Very low prices per SMS: starting from $0.0040 per sent message and $0.0040 per received message (Telnyx), or $0.0050 per sent message and $0 per received message (Plivo), or $0.0079 per sent message and 0.0075 per received message (Twilio), or $0.0040 per sent message and 0.0040 per received message (Flowroute) in the USA.\n\nWe have no affiliation with Telnyx, Plivo, Twilio or Flowroute.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Admin documentation](https://www.doublebastion.com/install-nextcloud/#install-sms-relentless)\n\n### Donations\n\n* üéÅ [Donate](https://www.doublebastion.com/donations/)",

    "description": "# Social login\n\nMake possible create users and login via Telegram, OAuth or OpenID\n\nFor OAuth you must create app for certain providers. Login button appear at login page if app id specified. Settings are in \"Social login\" section of settings page.\n\n## Installation\n\nLogin to your NextCloud installation as an administrator and under \"Apps\" click \"Download and enable\" next to the \"Social Login\" app.\n\nSee below for setup and configuration instructions.\n\n\n\n## Custom OAuth2/OIDC groups\n\nYou can use groups from your custom provider. For that you should specify \"Groups claim\" in custom OAuth2/OIDC provider settings. That claim should be returned from provider in `id_token` or at user info endpoint. Format should be `array` or comma separated string. Eg (with claim named `roles`)\n\n```json\n{\"roles\": [\"admin\", \"user\"]}\n```\nor\n```json\n{\"roles\": \"admin,user\"}\n```\n\nAlso nested claims is supported. For example `resource_access.client-id.roles` for\n\n```json\n\"resource_access\": {\n   \"client-id\": {\n     \"roles\": [\n       \"client-role-1\",\n       \"client-role-2\"\n     ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThere is also support for setting the displayName:\n```\n{\"roles\": [{gid: 1, displayName: \"admin\"}, {gid: 2, displayName: \"user\"}]}\n```\n\n\nYou can use provider groups in two ways:\n\n1. Map provider groups to existing nextcloud groups\n2. Create provider groups in nextcloud and associate it to user (if appropriate option specified)\n\nIf you want sync groups on every login do not forget to check \"Update user profile every login\" setting\n\n## Examples for groups\n\n* You can find example how to configure WSO2IS for return roles claim with OIDC [here](https://medium.com/@dewni.matheesha/claim-mapping-and-retrieving-end-user-information-in-wso2is-cffd5f3937ff)\n* [GitLab OIDC allowing specific GitLab groups](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/gitlab.md)\n\n## Built-in OAuth providers\n\nYou can copy link of certain login button to get proper \"redirect url\" for OAuth app setting.\n\n* [Google](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/google.md)\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Facebook](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/facebook.md)\n* [Twitter](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/twitter.md)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top)\n* [Telegram](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/blob/master/docs/sso/telegram.md)\n* PlexTv - you can use any title as app id\n\nDetails about \"Allow login only from specified domain\" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)\nYou can use comma separated list for multiple domains\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' => true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.\nIf you want to temporary disable this function (e.g. for login as local admin), you can add `noredir=1` query parameter in url for login page. Something like `https://cloud.domain.com/login?noredir=1`\n\nTo set options for http client, you can use\n```php\n  'social_login_http_client' => [\n    'timeout' => 45,\n    'proxy' => 'socks4://127.0.0.1:9050', // Check https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html for allowed variants\n  ],\n```\nin `config.php`\n\n### Configurate a provider via CLI\n\nYou can configure everything from commandline by using the occ utility. To setup a oidc-provider replace the variables and URLs with values that match your deployment.\n```bash\nphp occ config:app:set sociallogin custom_providers --value='{\"custom_oidc\": [{\"name\": \"gitlab_oidc\", \"title\": \"Gitlab\", \"authorizeUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/authorize\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/token\", \"userInfoUrl\": \"https://gitlab.my-domain.org/oauth/userinfo\", \"logoutUrl\": \"\", \"clientId\": \"$my_application_id\", \"clientSecret\": \"$my_super_secret_secret\", \"scope\": \"openid\", \"groupsClaim\": \"groups\", \"style\": \"gitlab\", \"defaultGroup\": \"\"}]}'\n```\nto do this with docker you just need to add `docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME` in front of the command, or run it interactively from `docker exec -it -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME sh`\n\nTo find out how to configure other providers, just configure them in the GUI and take a look at the database afterwards:\n```\nmysql -u nextcloud -p nextcloud\nPassword: <yourpassword>\n\n> SELECT * FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid='sociallogin';\n```\n\nOr just run\n\n`docker exec -t -uwww-data CONTAINER_NAME php occ config:app:get sociallogin custom_providers`\n\n## Hint\n\n### About Callback(Reply) Url\nYou can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url. To make proper button visible, just fill certain provider settings with random data and change it later.\n\nSome users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.\nPlease set 'overwriteprotocol' => 'https', in your config.php file.",

    "description": "# Storj NextCloud App\n\nAdds external storage support for [Storj Decentralized Cloud Storage](https://storj.io) to [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)\n\nStorj Community contributed.\n\n* [Docker image](#docker-image)\n* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n    * [Detailed instructions for docker version of Nextcloud](#detailed-instructions-for-docker-version-of-nextcloud)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Configuration](#configuration)\n* [Maintainers](#maintainers)\n    * [Building](#building)\n    * [Publish to App Store](#publish-to-app-store)\n    * [Running tests](#running-tests)\n* [Known issues](#known-issues)\n\n## Docker image\n\nWe supply a ready-to-use Docker image with Nextcloud and Storj pre-installed. \n\n```\ndocker run storjthirdparty/nextcloud-app:23.0.4-apache \\\n    --env OBJECTSTORE_STORJ_ACCESS_GRANT=myaccessgrant \\\n    --env OBJECTSTORE_STORJ_BUCKET=mybucket\n```\n\nMore information at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/storjthirdparty/nextcloud-app)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Linux\n- x86_64 or ARM64\n- libffi installed\n\nThe PHP installation should have the FFI extension loaded and enabled unconditionally in php.ini:\n\n```\nextension=ffi\n\nffi.enable=true\n```\n\nDetailed instructions depend on your distro.\n\n### Detailed instructions for docker version of Nextcloud\n\nBy default the Nextcloud docker image comes without `FFI` support. But you can install it inside the container:\n\n```\ndocker exec -it nextcloud bash\nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# apt update \nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# apt install libffi-dev\nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# docker-php-ext-install ffi\n```\n\n(\"nextcloud\" is the name you gave the container earlier)\n\nThe extension is now enabled through `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-ffi.ini`\n\nAlso allow loading libraries at runtime:\n\n```\nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# echo ffi.enable=true > /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/ffi.ini\n```\n\nReload Apache:\n\n```\nroot@5f11b342df44:/var/www/html# apachectl graceful\n```\n\nTo make changes permanent you need to build your own image. Create a `Dockerfile`:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM nextcloud\nRUN apt update && apt install -y libffi-dev && docker-php-ext-install ffi\nRUN echo ffi.enable=true > /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/ffi.ini\n```\n\nAnd build it:\n\n```\ndocker build . -t my/nextcloud\n```\n\nNow you can run your own image, change `docker run ... nextcloud` to `docker run ... my/nextcloud`\n\n## Installation\n\nThis app is published on the [App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/storj).\n\nThere are two ways to install:\n- Install from the App Store GUI of your Nextcloud instance. Tap on your profile (top right) and then \"+ Apps\"\n- Download and extract the tarball in the folder `apps` of your Nextcloud installation\n\n## Configuration\n\nStorj works like any external object storage. See the documentation on docs.nextcloud.com:\n\n* [Configuring External Storage (GUI)](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/24/admin_manual/configuration_files/external_storage_configuration_gui.html)\n* [Configuring Object Storage as Primary Storage](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/24/admin_manual/configuration_files/primary_storage.html)\n\nThis is the configuration to set Storj as your primary storage:\n\n```php\n$CONFIG = [\n    'objectstore' => [\n        'class' => \\OCA\\Storj\\StorjObjectStore::class,\n        'arguments' => [\n            'serialized_access' => 'myaccessgrant',\n            'bucket' => 'mynextcloudbucket',\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n```\n\nPrimary storage is more responsive because it relies more on your local database, but does create small files, which is not the best usecase for Storj.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n### Building\n\nThe app can be built by using the provided Makefile by running:\n\n    make\n\n### Publish to App Store\n\nBump the version in [./appinfo/info.xml](./appinfo/info.xml)\n\nBuild un:\n\n    make && make appstore\n\nThe archive is located in build/artifacts/appstore. \nFollow the instructions at [https://apps.nextcloud.com/developer/apps/releases/new](http://apps.nextcloud.com/) to upload the app to the store.\n\n### Running tests\n\nYou can use the provided Makefile to run all tests by using:\n\n    make test\n\nThis will run the PHP unit and integration tests and if a package.json is present in the **js/** folder will execute **npm run test**\n\nOf course you can also install [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/getting-started.html) and use the configurations directly:\n\n    phpunit -c phpunit.xml\n\nor:\n\n    phpunit -c phpunit.integration.xml\n\nfor integration tests\n\n## Known issues\n\n- Enabling Xdebug profiling or debugging will cause a segfault",
